# Authorisation tokens

Each social network has its own miserable process for obtaining access tokens that will grant you sufficient permission to post to accounts or pages.

| Network | Notes | Documentation |
|-|-|-|
| Console | Not really a network. No tokens required. | |
| Mastodon | Define an app, get an access token. Remarkably simple. | [mastodon-notes.md](docs/mastodon-notes.md) |
| Facebook | Define an app, get a user access token, exchange it for a page access token. | [facebook-notes.md](docs/facebook-notes.md) |
| LinkedIn | TBC | |
| Twitter | TBC | |
| Discord | TBC | |
